# DigitalProduction.CommandLine
 Command line argument parsing library for .Net.

## Legacy
This library is derived directly from the Plossum command line parsing library.
- (Code project article and origianl source code.)[https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/19869/Powerful-and-simple-command-line-parsing-in-C]
- (NuGet package)[https://www.nuget.org/packages/Plossum.CommandLine]

## Issues
The NuGet package was available and functional, so the software was usable.  However, there were a few issues.
- The code was based on outdate an outdated framework.  This was causing compile time warnings.  
- The code base was not being maintained.
- The source code was only available as a download (it was static).  There wasn't a repository to contribute changes to.

## New Library
This effort was initiated to achieve several goals:
- Remove compile time warnings from using legacy frameworks.
- Provide a Github repository.
- Update the code base to use modern language features.
- Simplify the code base.
